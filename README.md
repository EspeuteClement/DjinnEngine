# DJINN ENGINE
---
A pure C game framework/engine, featuring automatic asset loading, hot code reloading and fast build times.

**Currently WIP**
## Features
* Automatic asset loading, with statically typed resources
* Instant Live C code reloading using TCC
* Few dependencies (Only SDL, TCC is optional)
* Powered by SDL and Opengl
* Portable
* Everything you need to compile is contained in this repository
* Optional IMGUI support using cImgui

## Getting Started
* Clone this repository
* Launch build.bat
* Launch djn_engine.exe

## Game code
* The game code is stored in `game/`
* This is the code that can be recompiled at run time (press F11 to reload the code in the game engine)
